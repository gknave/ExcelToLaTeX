# ExcelToLaTeX

From an Excel sheet, *sheet*, a preamble file, *preamble*, and a guide file, *entryStyle*, this code generates a LaTeX file.

The output file is generated by first copying *preamble* into the output file, then adding *entryStyle* for each row of
the Excel sheet, before finally adding the optional *endFile*. Each time the code encounters a double bracket in *entryStyle*,
the text is replaced by an entry in the Excel sheet. That is, each time {{Key}} is encountered, the entry from the 'Key' column
of *sheet* is output.
